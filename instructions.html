Game Description
	The Game is set during the latter half of the Cold War. It soon became apparent to the leaders of the Soviet Union that they could not compete with the Western Powers for much longer. The possibility of war was seen as an attractive alternative to slowly sinking into decay. China, taking advantage of the Westâ€™s preoccupation with the Soviet Union and their reluctance to fight any more in Asia has absorbed several smaller states and now casts its eyes on Japan. The U.S. now fearing the worst has roused its ally NATO and mustered its forces for the worst to happen.
